# Bladder Cancer ODE Model

Matlab code used to explore the interactions of a bladder cancer comprised of (1) high-prolliferative and non-immunogeneic, (2) low-proliferative and immunogenic, (3) high-proliferative and immunogenic, and (4) low-proliferative and non-immunogenic cell types in the presence of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

`bladder_ODE.m` contains the ordinary differential equations that define the hypothesized four different immuno-phenotypes of bladder cancer and affect of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. `testBCGscheduling_new.m` simulates the tumor cell population-based ODE model with BCG treatment.
